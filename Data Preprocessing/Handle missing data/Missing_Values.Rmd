This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Ctrl+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r}

```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Ctrl+Alt+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Ctrl+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.

```{r}
# Import dataset

data = read.csv('AirQualityUCI.csv')
```


```{r}
data$X = ifelse(is.na(data$X),
                     ave(data$X, FUN =  function(x) mean(x, na.rm = TRUE)),
                     data$X)
```

The missing values are in the column X. We select this column by data$X

ifelse:

- ifelse() has params (test, yes, no), it returns a value with same shape as test
- 'test' contains the testing conditions, is.na means the value is not available (Note: In R, impossible values, like the result after division by zero, are represented by NaN)

- yes: What to do if the testing condition is true? Here we replace the is.na values with the mean of the column X.
The ave() is function used to calculate the mean. Params: The data, and the function to actually calculate the mean. In the mean function, na.rm means to remove the na values from calculation.

- no: What to do if the testing condition is false? Here we keep the values same.
