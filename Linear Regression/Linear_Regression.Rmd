This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Ctrl+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r}
data = read.csv("housing.csv")
```
Getting required data fields, population and households from the data set

```{r}
population = data$population

households = data$households
```

The linear regression is to be created using the lm() method


The lm() function is as follows
     lm(formula, data, subset, weights, na.action,
     method = "qr", model = TRUE, x = FALSE, y = FALSE, qr = TRUE,
     singular.ok = TRUE, contrasts = NULL, offset, â€¦)

    Parameters
    1) formula is of the form response ~ cause

    2) data is the dataframe from where the response and cause variables are going to be taken.
    else from the environment

    3) subset: optional vector specifying subset of observations to be used

    4) na.action: function which specifies what to do if na values present

    5) method: method to be used for fitting. currently only method = "qr"

```{r}
regressor = lm(formula = households ~ population)
```

predict function returns dataframe containing model predicitions
  
predict() has only one parameter, the object which used as prediction model
  
```{r}
y_pred = predict(regressor)
```

Plotting the results

```{r}
library(ggplot2)
ggplot() +
  geom_point(aes(x = population, y = households),
             colour = 'red') +
  geom_line(aes(x = population, y = predict(regressor, newdata = data)),
            colour = 'blue') +
  ggtitle('Income vs House Value') +
  xlab('Median Income') +
  ylab('Median House Value')

```

Saving the results

```{r}
ggsave(
  filename = "predict.png",
  plot = last_plot(),
  device = NULL,
  path = NULL,
  scale = 1,
  width = NA,
  height = NA,
  units = c("in", "cm", "mm"),
  dpi = 300,
  limitsize = TRUE,
  #...
)

```
